# plotly-challenge

For the plotly challenge the goal was to create a dashboard using JavaScript that could display various forms of data about Belly Button Biodiversity.

In order to display the data, a json file needed to be first imported into the code. From there we needed to be able to display specific data from an indivduals sample which included demographic data, their sample values with accommodating ids and a gauge that shows the washing frequency of the person.

For all the samples provide, we also needed to display a bubble chart that changed in size and colour based on the number of sample values and the number of ids respectively.
